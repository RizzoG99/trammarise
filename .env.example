# Trammarise - Environment Variables Example
#
# IMPORTANT: API keys are now provided by users through the application UI.
# No environment variables are required for deployment.
#
# This file is kept for optional local development testing only.
# For production deployment, users will enter their own API keys directly
# in the web interface when processing audio.

# Optional: OpenAI API Key for local development testing
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

# Note: In production, users provide their own keys via the UI for:
# - OpenAI (Whisper transcription + optional GPT-4 summarization)
# - Claude (Anthropic) for summarization
# - Deepseek for summarization
